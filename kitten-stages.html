            <h1>Kitten to Cat Life Stages</h1>
            <p>
                Understanding the stages of a cat's life is crucial for providing appropriate care. This guide covers
                the various stages from kittenhood to adulthood, including developmental milestones and care tips.
                Each stage has unique needs and behaviors that are important to recognize for a healthy, happy cat.

            <h2>Kitten Stage (0-6 months)</h2>
            <p>
                Kittens are born blind and deaf, relying on their mother for warmth and nourishment. They begin to open
                their eyes and ears around two weeks old. By six weeks, they start to explore their environment and
                learn social skills through play with their littermates.
            </p>
            <h2>Juvenile Stage (6 months - 2 years)</h2>
            <p>
                During this stage, cats become more independent and may start to exhibit territorial behaviors. They
                require plenty of playtime and mental stimulation to prevent boredom. This is also the time when they
                should be spayed or neutered if not already done.
            </p>

            <h2>Adulthood (2-10 years)</h2>
            <p>
                Adult cats are generally more settled and less active than juveniles. They require regular veterinary
                check-ups, a balanced diet, and continued mental stimulation. This stage is crucial for maintaining
                their
                health and preventing obesity.
            </p>
            <h2>Senior Stage (10+ years)</h2>
            <p>
                Senior cats may experience health issues such as arthritis or dental problems. Regular vet visits are
                essential to monitor their health. Providing a comfortable environment and adjusting their diet can help
                them live a happy, healthy life in their golden years.
